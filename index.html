        <p>The purpose of this project was to was to analyze how weather
          changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this 
          analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to 
          assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.</p>

          <p>After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various
          aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included:
          temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides
          the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis,
          as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and
          correlations witnessed.</p>
