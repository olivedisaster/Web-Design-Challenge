  <p>The purpose of this project was to was to analyze how weather
  changes as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this 
  analysis, we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap API to 
  assemble a dataset on over 500 cities.

  After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various
  aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at included:
  temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides
  the source data and visualizations created as part of the analysis,
  as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and
  correlations witnessed.
